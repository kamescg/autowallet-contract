   * @dev Allows smartcontracts to access the liquidity of the pool within one transaction,
   * as long as the amount taken plus a fee is returned.
   * IMPORTANT There are security concerns for developers of flashloan receiver contracts that must be kept into consideration.
   * For further details please visit https://developers.aave.com
   * @param receiverAddress The address of the contract receiving the funds, implementing the IFlashLoanReceiver interface
   * @param assets The addresses of the assets being flash-borrowed
   * @param amounts The amounts amounts being flash-borrowed
   * @param modes Types of the debt to open if the flash loan is not returned:
   *   0 -> Don't open any debt, just revert if funds can't be transferred from the receiver
   *   1 -> Open debt at stable rate for the value of the amount flash-borrowed to the `onBehalfOf` address
   *   2 -> Open debt at variable rate for the value of the amount flash-borrowed to the `onBehalfOf` address
   * @param onBehalfOf The address  that will receive the debt in the case of using on `modes` 1 or 2
   * @param params Variadic packed params to pass to the receiver as extra information
   * @param referralCode Code used to register the integrator originating the operation, for potential rewards.
   *   0 if the action is executed directly by the user, without any middle-man
